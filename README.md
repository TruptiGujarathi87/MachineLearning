# MachineLearning

Supervised Learning:
=====================
	-Train an algorithm on a labelled dataset (training data) to predict the correct output value
		for unseen inputs (testing data)
		
	-Input/Output
	-Labelled data
	-Classification & Regression
 
Algorithms used in Supervised Learning:
 ========================================

Regression & Classification Algorithms:

		-Linear Regression => Regression
		-Logistic Regression => Classification
		
		-Decision Tree =>Regression & Classification
		-Naive Bayes =>Regression & Classification
		-Support Vector Machine =>Classification
		-Random Forest =>Regression & Classification
		-Ensemble => Regression & Classification


 Unsupervised Learning:
=======================
	-Train an algorithm to find similarities on abnormalities in the data set.
	
	-Input
	-Unlabelled data
	-Clustering
 

Algorithms used in Unsupervised Learning:
 ==========================================
	-Clustering algorithms
		-Kmean
		-K-medoid
		-Hierarchical
		-DBScan
 

Reinforncement Learning:
 ==========================
	-Learn through trial and error basis from interaction with an environment.
	-States and action
	-No dataset required
	-Decision making
