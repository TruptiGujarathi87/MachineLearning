# MachineLearning

Supervised Learning:
=====================
	-Train an algorithm on a labelled dataset (training data) to predict the correct output value
		for unseen inputs (testing data)
		
	-Input/Output
	-Labelled data
	-Classification & Regression


 Unsupervised Learning:
=======================
	-Train an algorithm to find similarities on abnormalities in the data set.
	
	-Input
	-Unlabelled data
	-Clustering
 

Reinforncement Learning:
 ==========================
	-Learn through trial and error basis from interaction with an environment.
	-States and action
	-No dataset required
	-Decision making
