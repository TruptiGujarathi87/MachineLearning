#Problem Statement

Objective:

Develop a machine learning model to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions among a dataset of European cardholder transactions from the year 2023.

Background:
Credit card fraud is a major concern for financial institutions and cardholders alike, leading to significant financial losses and security issues. With the increasing volume of digital transactions, traditional rule-based systems are becoming less effective, necessitating the need for advanced, scalable, and efficient fraud detection solutions.

Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises over 550,000 records of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in 2023. It includes the following features:

id: Unique identifier for each transaction.
V1-V28: Anonymized features representing various aspects of each transaction, likely encompassing time, location, amount, and other transactional details.
Amount: The transaction amount.
Class: Binary label (1 for fraudulent, 0 for non-fraudulent transactions).

Tasks: 
Data Preprocessing: Address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

Feature Engineering: Derive new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

Model Selection: Experiment with various algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better performance.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the modelâ€™s robustness and generalizability.
